            <p>Hello, my name is <strong>Giuseppe Mancini</strong> and I am a web developer. I recently published this small project on GitHub to introduce myself to potential employers. My project is a simple web application that uses <strong>HTML</strong> , <strong>CSS</strong>, and <strong>JavaScript</strong> technologies to create an interactive Modal web page with some animations and hover effects.

        <div class="second-modal hidden">

            <p>I decided to publish this project on GitHub because it is a popular platform among developers and employers, and it offers me the opportunity to showcase my skills and programming style. I hope that my project can attract the attention of some employers and offer me the opportunity to demonstrate my abilities in a working environment.

            <p>I love challenges and learn quickly because I have a strong passion for web technology. I enjoy being constantly engaged in new projects and challenges, which allow me to acquire new skills and improve my programming abilities. I am always searching for new technologies and tools that enable me to create increasingly complex and innovative projects. Thanks to my passion for web technology, I am always motivated and ready to tackle any challenge that comes my way, whether it is a new technology or a challenging project. I hope that my passion and determination can demonstrate my commitment to this profession and my interest in continuously growing as a web developer
